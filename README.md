(List Pagination | Filtering | DOM Manipulation)

In this project I set out to develop the challenge myself to develop the skills necessary to utilize a common web development technique known as "pagination" in order that I might be equipped to enhance the usability of any/all web pages whose lists/arrays/content is content is so extensive that it would warrant the splitting up of those items/objects into seperate pages for better consumption. I hope to employe this on projects I develop in the near future.
